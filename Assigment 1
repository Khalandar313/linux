1. What is Linux Operating System (OS)? Also, list three pros and cons of it. 
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the UNIX style model. Linux works for the management of hardware resources and security; it also offers the user interface for the running of applications.It acts as a bridge between computer hardware and software. 
Pros: 
1. Free and open-source; hence, no license cost. 
2. Highly secure when compared to multiple other OS. 
3. Very stable and crashes almost never. 

Cons: 
1. It is not beginner-friendly
2. Does not support some commercial software, like MS Office. 
3. Driver support is sometimes tricky in hardware.       
 
2. Differentiate between Linux, Mac, Android, and Windows OS with at least six features each. 
-Linux:It is a Open-source, customizable, secure, widely used in servers supporting multiple distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora), strong community support. 
-Mac: It is exclusively available on Apple devices, elegant GUI, strong integration of iPhone/iPad, paid license, very strong multimedia support, closed-source. 
-Android: Based on Linux kernel for mobile platform, open source with Google services, millions of apps supported, touch-optimized, most used mobile OS. 
-Windows: Paid OS, user-friendly GUI, widest software compatibility, dominant PC market share, closed source, and it has good gaming support.

3. Why is Linux preferred for Mainframe Servers for legacy application? 
1. It is extremely stable and reliable (servers run for months/years without reboot). 2. Offers strong security features. 3. Cost-effective because it is open-source and doesn’t require expensive licenses.
4. Explain the structure of the Linux File System with proper diagram.
Linux follows a hierarchical file system starting with the root directory '/'. Everything (files, devices, programs) exists under this root.  Example using the tree command: / ├── bin    (essential commands) ├── etc    (configuration files) ├── home   (user files) ├── lib    (libraries) ├── root   (root user home) ├── var    (logs, variable data) └── usr    (user applications)
5. If Linux OS is open-source, how do companies like Red Hat still making money from it? 
Companies like Red Hat don’t sell Linux itself (since it’s free). They make money by: - Providing enterprise-level support and maintenance services. - Offering training and certification programs. - Selling customized solutions with guaranteed stability and updates. - Partnering with corporations and governments that need reliable server solutions.
6. Write the command to display today’s date and time (i.e., current System time). 
date
7. Which command is used to check how long the system has been running? 
uptime
8. What is the difference between shutdown -h now and halt?
- shutdown -h now → It safely shuts down the system,it will close all process before power off. - halt → Immediately stops the CPU butit will  not safely close all processes.
9. Compare init 0 and shutdown -h. Which is safer? Why?
- init 0 → Puts the system in runlevel 0 (halts the system). - shutdown -h → Gracefully shuts down, notifying users and stopping services safely.  Shutdown -h is safer because it ensures processes are closed properly before shutdown.
10. A system administrator accidentally powers off a Server machine without shutting it down properly. What problems can occur to the said Server? 
- Data loss or corruption (unsaved work or database issues). - File system damage leading to boot problems. - Services may not restart properly on reboot. - Hardware stress due to sudden power cut.
Brainstorming
a) As Linux Kernel is open-source, can we build our own operating system? Yes, since Linux Kernel is open-source, anyone can modify and build a custom OS. Examples include Android, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.  b) In order to do that, what are the stoppers, hurdles, and challenges? - Requires deep technical knowledge. - Time-consuming and resource-heavy. - Compatibility issues with hardware and drivers. - Need for long-term support and updates.  c) Is anyone in India working on this field? Find at least three to four engineers. Yes, India has engineers working on open-source and Linux-based projects. Examples include: 1. Kris Gopalakrishnan 2. Nandan Nilekani 3. Developers at C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) building Bharat Operating System Solutions – BOSS Linux. 4. Open-source communities in India (FOSS.IN, ICFOSS Kerala).
