1. What does the command pwd, whoami, and hostname display?
• pwd → It prints the working directory   Eg: /home/student/project.
• whoami → It shows the username of the person    Eg: student.
• hostname →It  displays the system’s name on the network   Eg:kali


 2. Write the command to create a directory named “project” inside /home/student and keep three .txt files in it.
mkdir /home/student/project cd /home/student/project touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt 


3. Difference between absolute path and relative path with examples.
• Absolute Path →It  always starts from the root `/`
Eg:/home/student/project/file1.txt 
• Relative Path → It is based on current working directory.
 Example: if you are in /home/student/project, just typing file1.txt refers to the same file. 


4. What command will give you already executed command traces in the terminal?
history 


5. Compare find and locate. Which one is faster and why?
• find → Searches directly on the filesystem.              It is accurate but slower.
• locate → Uses a prebuilt database of files Much faster but may miss very recent changes unless updated Locate is faster because it checks 
a database instead of scanning the disk every time.



 6. Which command is used to modify file permissions in Linux? Example.
chmod Eg: chmod 755 file1.txt  


7. A file has permissions -rw-r--r--. What does this mean?
• - → Regular file • rw- → Owner can read and write • r-- → Group can only read • r-- → Others can only read  


8. Difference between chown and chgrp with example.
The chown command changes the ownership of a file to a different user. Example: chown alice report.txt gives ownership of report.txt to Alice.
The chgrp command changes the group ownership. Example:chgrp project report.txt puts report.txt in the "project" group.

9. A file needs to be accessible by multiple users but only writable by the owner. How will you set permissions?
chmod 644 filename  


10. How do you check the manual page for any Linux command?
 man <command_name> Example: man ls
